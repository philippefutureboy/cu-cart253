## Description

Git repository for my submissions for the CART 253 A 2252 (Fall 2025) course at Concordia University.

Repository is structured alongside the submission structure for the course:

- `/challenges` contains the in-class challenge submissions
- `/projects` contains the take-home jam submissions

## Attribution

To the best of my ability, elements that are not my own work, including images, sounds, code, or otherwise are accompanied with the relevant attribution notice, whether in the form of a README, LICENSE (where LICENSE inclusion is required by the original work), code comments, or otherwise.

When a dependencies file (like package.json) is included, listing a library there is taken to count as proper attribution for that library. No extra citation or disclaimer is added unless specifically required. Should marks be deductable for the absence of extra citation, I kindly request that the examinator reaches out to me to ask for the appropriate modifications prior to deducting marks.
