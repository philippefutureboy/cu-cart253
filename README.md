## Description

Git repository for my submissions for the CART 253 A 2252 (Fall 2025) course at Concordia University.

Repository is structured alongside the submission structure for the course:

- `/challenges` contains the in-class challenge submissions
- `/projects` contains the take-home jam submissions

## Attribution

To the best of my ability, elements that are not my own work, including images, sounds, code, or otherwise are accompanied with the relevant attribution notice, whether in the form of a README, LICENSE (where LICENSE inclusion is required by the original work), code comments, or otherwise.

When a dependencies file (like package.json) is included, listing a library there is taken to count as proper attribution for that library. No extra citation or disclaimer is added unless specifically required. Should marks be deductable for the absence of extra citation, I kindly request that the examinator reaches out to me to ask for the appropriate modifications prior to deducting marks.

## Usage of Generative AI

The course policy for CART 253 that no student will use AI tools or similar to produce their work.
This policy is in place to ensure that students learn and integrate the programming concepts taught in the course.

Given my extensive experience (10 years, 7 years as CTO, using a large number of technologies), I have requested
an exemption to said course policy so that I can focus on the more creative aspects of the class - bringing ideas to life.

Following a discussion with Dr Barr, I was granted said exemption, with the caveats that:

- Generative AI may not be used as part of the in-class challenges
- I be transparent about my use of Generative AI wherever it is used in my projects by providing attribution
- I be transparent with my colleagues about the motives and reasoning behind this exemption should the question arise
- I use Generative AI with caution and awareness to avoid being unconsciously creatively led by GenAI in my creative choices
- I use Generative AI in a way that does not undermine my creative integrity and makes me feel aligned and excited
- I make a tacit effort at learning to work within the constraints of P5 (prefer a P5 solution when possible and preferable).

This use of Generative AI is also subject of Dr Barr's review, and he may revoke this exemption should he deem it fit to do so.
