# CART 253 – Making Challenge

Author: PHILIPPE HEBERT

## IdEas

- Side to side swinging tongue (spring)
- Snake-like tongue (moves left/right, tracing a path)
- Fly that grows bigger over time (and maybe the fly becomes the predator)?
- Inverted game: The frog tries to eat on its own, but you gotta help it
- Inverted game: Hurl the frog using its tongue
- Inverted game: The fly tries to escape the frog (Yoshi’s Island)
- Inverted game: The fly hunts the frog
- Multiplayers game: Multiple frogs eat flies (like the crocodiles with marbles game)
- Frog in a centrigual chamber / in a washing machine
- Frog in gradually heating up water
- Frog in free fall (bottom-scroller/ top-down)
- Frog, as in the “frog” word
- Frog chases fly, with hurdles along the way (side-scroll or top-scroll)
- Another animal eats the frog / recursive eating
- Color filters that make fly/tongue/frog show up/disappear (multiplayer? Think talk and nobody explodes)
- Capitalist frog with tophat eats flies
- Multistep game - think Inscryption
    - A probability version where the frog catches the fly only if a prediction is correct
- A game where you are a fly bartender at a frog bar, and you must serve your patron their requested drinks before they grow frustrated and eat you
- A game where you are a fly in the middle of the game, and turn by turn you can move one spot to reach a poop pile, but the whole canvas is populated by frogs, and there are a bunch of buttons randomly associated with the frogs, and you have to click one of them to see which frog will launch its tongue (and possibly eat you)
- A minesweeper game where you are the fly, and every time you click to a new spot, if there’s a frog pointed towards you in the space opened up, you die
