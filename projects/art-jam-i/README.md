## Description

Art Jam I submission.

Presents a literal portrait of myself as an SVG outline; upon user interaction, fills
up a bar, to then display a video [Transcendence - Limitless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3p_9-R_siI) and play some animations of the SVG on top.

I think this is a very fitting self-portrait of myself -

- The project is well technically architected, with clean separation of concerns and interfaces, which reflects my experience (and inclinations towards more engineering than less)
- The video reflects my interest in ontology, metaphysics, spirituality, and curiosity
- The video reflects my humour (at the end principally)
- The global idea reflects my technical background, but also limited creativity, in the sense that I took "self-portrait" quite literal rather than creatively. It's something I'd like to improve on the next project.
