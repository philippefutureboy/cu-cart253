# React-P5 Declarative Integration

This package provides a **declarative React integration for p5.js**, designed as a more flexible and composable alternative to [`@p5-wrapper/react`](https://github.com/p5-wrapper/react).

It enables you to use `p5` sketches directly inside React applications in a way that feels idiomatic: components, hooks, and context providers rather than imperative setup.

---

## ‚ú® Key Advantages Over `@p5-wrapper/react`

- **Declarative API**  
  Define `<P5.Setup>` and `<P5.Draw>` directly inside JSX. Lifecycle is tied to React‚Äôs reconciliation, not imperative re-instantiation.

- **Hot-swap draw functions**  
  Replace `<P5.Draw fn={...} />` on the fly without tearing down the canvas. Enables **multi-scene** workflows and interactive transitions.

- **Multiple p5 instance support**  
  Use `<P5.Canvas id="...">` to mount multiple independent canvases. Each canvas is registered in global context for hooks and management.

- **React state & interactivity**  
  Pass `params` into setup/draw functions. Combine with React state, props, or context to declaratively control visual state. Ideal for building **data models** or **state-driven scenes**.

- **Easy integration in React apps**  
  Fits into existing component trees and tooling (Vite, Babel, Jest). Plays nicely with standard React patterns (hooks, context, state).

- **Extends p5 with modern app features**  
  Because you are in React, you can seamlessly integrate:  
  - Network requests (REST, GraphQL, etc.)  
  - Local caching and persistence (React Query, SWR)  
  - Real-time multiplayer via WebSockets or WebRTC  

  ```jsx
  import { P5 } from "src/lib/p5";
  import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

  function MultiplayerCanvas({ socket }) {
    const [players, setPlayers] = useState({});

    useEffect(() => {
      socket.on("players:update", (payload) => setPlayers(payload));
    }, [socket]);

    return (
      <P5.Canvas id="game" width={800} height={600} renderer="WEBGL">
        <P5.Setup fn={(p5) => p5.background(0)} />
        <P5.Draw fn={(p5) => {
          p5.background(0);
          Object.values(players).forEach(({ x, y }) => {
            p5.ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);
          });
        }} />
      </P5.Canvas>
    );
  }

## üì¶ Installation

This code lives inside your project under `src/lib/p5`.
No npm install step is required, but you do need `p5`:

```bash
npm install p5
```

---

## üöÄ Basic Usage

```jsx
import { P5 } from "src/lib/p5";

function Example() {
  return (
    <P5.ContextProvider>
      <P5.Canvas id="demo" width={400} height={300}>
        <P5.Setup fn={(p5) => p5.background(200)} />
        <P5.Draw fn={(p5) => {
          p5.background(200);
          p5.ellipse(p5.width / 2, p5.height / 2, 50, 50);
        }} />
      </P5.Canvas>
    </P5.ContextProvider>
  );
}
```

### Hooks

* `useP5(id)` ‚Üí access `{ ready, p5Ref, canvasRef, size }` for a specific canvas
* `useP5List()` ‚Üí get an array of all registered canvas IDs

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Disadvantages

* **SSR caveats**: p5 requires DOM APIs. This lib guards against hydration mismatches, but server-side rendering won‚Äôt render sketches. Use `typeof window !== "undefined"` to defer if needed.
* **No pixel snapshots in tests**: The Jest setup mocks p5. Automated tests validate lifecycle/registry logic, not actual rendering output.
* **Draw hot-swap is one-at-a-time**: Only the most recent `<P5.Draw>` child defines `draw`. You can replace dynamically but not run multiple draws in parallel.
* **Canvas resize vs recreate**: Changing `width/height` resizes, but changing renderer (`P2D` ‚Üî `WEBGL`) forces a full re-create.

---

## üìñ API Reference

### `<P5.ContextProvider>`

Global registry provider. Wrap once near the root of your app.

### `<P5.Canvas id width height renderer className style>`

Mount a p5 canvas.

* `id` (string) ‚Äì required, unique
* `width`, `height` (number) ‚Äì canvas size
* `renderer` (`"P2D" | "WEBGL"`) ‚Äì defaults to `"P2D"`

### `<P5.Setup fn params />`

One-time setup function. Changing `fn` triggers full canvas recreate.

### `<P5.Draw fn params />`

Draw loop function. Changing `fn` hot-swaps without recreate.

### `useP5(id)`

Access registry entry for a given canvas:

```ts
{
  ready: boolean;
  p5Ref: Ref<p5|null>;
  canvasRef: Ref<HTMLCanvasElement|null>;
  size: { width: number, height: number };
}
```

### `useP5List()`

Returns all registered canvas IDs.

This being said, I, as the author, Philippe Hebert, have made some creative choices, especially around architecting/directing
the structure of this solution, and as such, I am de-facto the "author" of this work.
This being said, given that ChatGPT is trained using the work of countless developers, most of then time irrespectively of licensing, I also included "The Internet Collective" as a noteworthy, but non-enforceable copyright holder.
